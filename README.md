# cartesian-product
Python 3 application to find the cartesian product of sets usage: 

cartesian-product [-h] [-u] [-U] list [list ...] positional arguments:
  list List(s) to compute the cartesian product of optional arguments:
  -h, --help show this help message and exit
  -u, --unique Deduplicate lists so that they become sets of unique
                        elements
  -U, --Universally_unique
                        Deduplicate the resulting cartesian product so it
                        becomes a set of unique elements that have no 
repeated
                        values
